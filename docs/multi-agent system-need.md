The technology stack for building a multi-agent system (MAS) in 2025 typically includes the following components and technologies:

### Core AI and Models
- Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o or specialized reasoning models provide the core intelligence for agents.
- Reinforcement Learning agents or neuro-symbolic systems may be used for learning and reasoning.
  
### Agent Frameworks and Orchestration
- Agent orchestration frameworks such as AutoGen, LangGraph, or Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK) manage agent collaboration and communication.
- These frameworks provide modular, layered architectures for scaling agents from prototypes to production-ready systems.
  
### Communication & Messaging Infrastructure
- Messaging systems like Kafka, RabbitMQ, or Azure Service Bus handle reliable, scalable communication across agents.
- This layer supports event-driven interactions, asynchronous message passing, and service discovery.

### Memory and Knowledge
- Persistent storage options such as vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate) for similarity search.
- Graph databases (Neo4j, RedisGraph) and Elasticsearch for structured, unstructured, and relational data.
- These storage solutions help agents maintain context and share knowledge.

### Infrastructure and Deployment
- Cloud platforms with Kubernetes for container orchestration, serverless architectures for dynamic scaling.
- Edge computing to reduce latency by processing closer to users.
- Secure sandboxed execution environments ensure secure and compliant operation of agents.

### Tool Integration
- Agents access external APIs, databases, web browsing, and specialized domain tools.
- Standardized protocols like OpenTools facilitate smooth tool integration and API authorization.

### Monitoring, Observability, and Governance
- Specialized platforms provide monitoring of agent actions, health, workflow tracing, logging, and debugging.
- Governance layers enforce security policies, compliance, and ethical guardrails.

### Programming and Development
- Languages like Python are dominant for AI agent coding.
- Front-end tech such as React may be used for user interaction components in multi-agent applications.

This stack allows building scalable, modular, and enterprise-grade multi-agent systems capable of autonomous planning, coordination, and execution with strong observability and secure operations.[1][2][3][4]
